# üìÑ PDF Question Answering with Speech Conversion

## Overview

This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that allows users to upload a PDF file, extract its text, and ask questions about the content. The system leverages **Langchain** for question answering and utilizes the **Sarvam API** to convert the generated responses into speech. The user-friendly interface is built using **Streamlit**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **PDF Text Extraction**: Upload PDF files and extract their content using **PyMuPDF**.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions and receive relevant answers using **GPT-3.5** via Langchain.
- **Speech Conversion**: Convert the text-based answers into speech using the **Sarvam API**.
- **User Interface**: A web-based interface built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to easily upload PDFs, ask questions, and listen to the answers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the interactive web app.
- **PyMuPDF**: Library for extracting text from PDF files.
- **Langchain**: A library for building RAG systems, integrating **GPT-3.5** for question answering.
- **Sarvam API**: Converts the text responses generated by GPT-3.5 into speech.
- **OpenAI API**: Provides access to GPT-3.5 models for natural language processing and question-answering.

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
    cd repository-name
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pymupdf requests langchain
    ```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Replace `YOUR_SARVAM_API_KEY` with your actual Sarvam API key.
   - Replace `YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your actual OpenAI API key.

   You can store these keys in a `.env` file or directly in the code as needed.

## üéØ Usage

1. Run the **Streamlit** app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:8501
    ```

3. **How to Use**:
    - **Upload a PDF**: Use the interface to upload a PDF file.
    - **Ask a Question**: Enter a question based on the uploaded PDF's content.
    - **Convert Answer to Speech**: Click on the "Convert Answer to Speech" button to hear the response.

## üß© Code Overview

### Main Functions:

- `extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)`: Extracts text from the uploaded PDF using **PyMuPDF**.
- `text_to_speech_sarvam(text)`: Converts text to speech using the **Sarvam API**.
- `setup_rag_model(text)`: Initializes the **RAG** model for question answering based on the extracted PDF content.

### Streamlit Interface:

The **Streamlit** interface allows users to:
- Upload PDFs.
- Ask questions about the content.
- Convert text-based answers to speech.

## üìö Assignment Parts Completed

- **Part 1**: Built a **RAG** system that extracts text from PDFs and answers questions using **GPT-3.5** via Langchain.
- **Part 2**: Developed an intelligent agent that determines when to query the vector database based on user input.
- **Part 3 (Bonus)**: Integrated the **Sarvam API** to convert text answers into speech, enhancing the app's accessibility.
